## Project proposal

### Synopsis
Animal pose estimation frameworks have advanced the study of animal behavior, yet their outputs can be marred by occasional inaccuracies such as keypoints that "jump" to implausible locations. This project proposes the design and implementation of a comprehensive outlier detection module for the movement package. By integrating methods based on temporal smoothness, pose plausibility, and multi-view consistency, this solution aims to automatically flag a high percentage of erroneous keypoint predictions while maintaining low false positive rates, thereby significantly improving the quality control process in animal behavior research.

### Implementation timeline

#### Minimal set of deliverables:
- Temporal smoothness-based outlier detection algorithm:
    - Implement a two-stage approach for improved robustness:
        - **Stage 1 (Single-frame detection):** Implement *bidirectional* displacement analysis (checking t-1 <-> t and t <-> t+1). Utilize *adaptive thresholding* (e.g., based on Median Absolute Deviation - MAD) instead of fixed values. Offer both uni-directional and bi-directional checks as options.
        - **Stage 2 (Cluster/Oscillation detection):** Develop methods to identify continuous segments of errors and specialized patterns like *high-frequency oscillations* (position swaps).
    - Explore Procrustes analysis (`scipy.spatial.procrustes`) for supplementary shape consistency checks.
- Pose plausibility checks using hybrid data-driven and anatomical constraints:
    - Implement *adaptive PCA manifold learning*, potentially including *incremental updates* to allow model adaptation over time and exploring *behavior-specific subspaces*.
    - Integrate *kinematic chain validation* using species-specific constraints on joint angles and relative bone lengths.
- Multi-view consistency verification for setups with multiple camera views:
    - Implement robust geometric checks based on *epipolar geometry*, potentially using *RANSAC* for outlier rejection during fundamental matrix estimation.
    - Incorporate *uncertainty estimation* (e.g., weighting reprojection errors based on prediction confidence or calibration uncertainty).
    - Explore integrating temporal information via *temporal-spatial consistency filters* (e.g., Kalman filters combined with reprojection).
- Comprehensive API for integration with existing pose estimation workflows.
- Test suite using both synthetic and real-world datasets:
    - Include *synthetic error injection* (e.g., noise, jumps, swaps) for controlled evaluation.
    - Measure performance using standard metrics (*Precision, Recall, F1-score*).
- Documentation and examples demonstrating the module's usage.

#### Stretch goals:
- Adaptive thresholding mechanism that calibrates to different animal species
- Integration with the movement gallery for before-and-after trajectory visualization

### Anticipated Challenges and Proposed Solutions
Based on preliminary analysis and common issues in pose estimation, we anticipate the following challenges and propose corresponding mitigation strategies:
1.  **Adaptive Threshold Calibration:** Outlier thresholds may need adjustment based on behavior, species, or experimental conditions. 
    *   **Solution:** Implement session-specific baseline calculations (e.g., using MAD) and potentially explore velocity-dependent adjustments to automatically tune thresholds.
2.  **Novel Behavior Handling:** Pre-trained PCA models might incorrectly flag poses from behaviors not seen during training.
    *   **Solution:** Maintain behavior-specific PCA subspaces where feasible. Implement mechanisms for handling 'Unknown' poses, possibly queuing them for manual review or using active learning loops to update models.
3.  **Calibration Error Mitigation:** Inaccurate camera calibration can degrade multi-view consistency checks.
    *   **Solution:** While robust calibration is external, the multi-view checks will incorporate uncertainty. Explore possibilities for online calibration refinement (e.g., bundle adjustment using detected keypoints) as a potential extension if initial checks prove too sensitive to minor calibration drift.

### Communication plan
I plan to communicate with my mentors (@niksirbi and @sfmig) through:
- Weekly video calls to discuss progress and address challenges
- Regular updates on the Zulip chat for day-to-day questions
- GitHub PR reviews for code feedback
- Asynchronous communication through email when needed

## Personal statement

### Past experience
I hold a Bachelor's degree with a dual major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics (CGPA: 3.7/4.0) from San Jose State University. I've worked as a Machine Learning Engineer until December 2024, where I built scalable machine learning models. I have extensive experience in Python, C++, JavaScript, and deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow). I've contributed to high-impact open-source projects such as DeepMind OpenSpiel and DeepMind TORAX, and most recently to the movement package through several pull requests.

### Motivation: why this project?
Animal behavior research is a critical field that increasingly relies on accurate pose estimation. The current limitations in detecting outliers can lead to erroneous conclusions or require excessive manual work. I'm motivated to tackle this challenge because it combines my technical skills in machine learning and signal processing with a meaningful application in scientific research. Creating a robust outlier detection system will significantly enhance data quality and research reproducibility in this field.

### Match: why you?
My unique combination of academic background, industry experience, and open-source contributions makes me well-suited for this project. My dual major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics provides the theoretical foundation needed for implementing statistical methods like PCA and Kalman filters. My experience as a Machine Learning Engineer has equipped me with practical skills in developing scalable, production-quality code. Additionally, my prior contributions to the movement package demonstrate my familiarity with the codebase and my ability to implement features that meet the project's standards.

### Availability
I will be dedicating 30-35 hours per week to this project throughout the GSoC period, for a total of approximately 350 hours. I have no conflicting commitments during this time and have arranged my schedule to ensure full availability for this project.

## GSoC

### GSoC experience
From the GSoC program, I expect to gain valuable experience in collaborative open-source development, working with domain experts, and creating software that has a real impact on scientific research. I look forward to improving my skills in Python, testing methodologies, and documentation practices while contributing to the neuroinformatics community.
